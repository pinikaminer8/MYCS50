I would characterize their audio aura by genre Distribution:
Analyzing the distribution of
genres within the top 100 songs can help
characterize the listener's audio aura. By
identifying the most prominent genres in their top
songs, we can gain an understanding of their
preferences and the overall mood and atmosphere
of their music selection. For example, if the
majority of the songs fall under upbeat and
energetic genres like pop, rock, or EDM, it may
indicate a more lively and energetic audio aura.


But, understanding the listener's audio aura requires considering external factors such as
personal experiences, cultural background, and the context in which the music is
enjoyed. These factors can significantly influence the listener's emotional response to
music, which cannot be captured solely through song attributes.

Therefore, using a combination of advanced audio analysis techniques that map
specific audio features (eg, rhythm, tempo, tonality) to emotional states can offer a
more accurate understanding of the listener's audio aura. This approach goes beyond
simple averages and takes into account the complex relationship between music and
emotions.
