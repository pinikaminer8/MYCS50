## About

This repository is dedicated to showcasing the projects and assignments I've completed as part of the CS50 course. CS50 is an introductory computer science course offered by Harvard University. Throughout the course, I've learned various programming concepts, algorithms, data structures, and more.

## Final Project

The highlight of my CS50 journey is the completion of the final project. This project is a culmination of the skills and knowledge I've gained during the course. I've designed and implemented a unique project that demonstrates my abilities and creativity in the realm of computer science.

The final project showcases my problem-solving skills, coding proficiency, and understanding of relevant technologies. I've documented the project extensively to provide insights into the thought process, challenges faced, and solutions devised.

## Usage
