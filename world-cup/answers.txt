Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
It seems that in a run of N=10 Belgium got a not very high chance of winning while in a run of N=100000 Belgium got the highest chance of winning

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
The predictions seem to be good enough after 100000 simulations
